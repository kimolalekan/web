          express your interest in a product or service for which you would like more information.
          We will also ensure that your opt-in is explicit and that we provide a clear description
          of what data would be shared with the third-party. Please, note that once you choose to
          allow us send your information to a third-party website, we will not be responsible for
          how they deal with your information.

          <b>YOUR CHOICES</b>
          <br />
          You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. You
          can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms
          we use to collect your data. You can also exercise this right at any time by using any of
          the various “opt-out” options that we will always provide to you when we communicate with
          you. Note that we have a variety of services and opting out of one, does not automatically
          remove you from all other services. You cannot opt-out of routine service correspondence
          from us, because then we would not be able to provide services to you.
